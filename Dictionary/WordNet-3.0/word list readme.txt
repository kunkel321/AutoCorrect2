The wordnet word list merely shows what words are in the WordNet databases. It doesn’t actually get used for anything.  It is okay to delete the list.   

FYI:  I don’t recommend using the list inplace of the ‘GitHubComboList249k.txt’ word list.  The WordNet list contains 147,305 words (some are two-word phrases) but it is missing some very common words, such as “the”.    Therefore, if you use it in the comparison lists in the Exam Pane, you might get inadvertent erroneous spellings..

Also: Download your own copy of the WordNet database here:  https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download  The database has lots of features like synonyms and antonyms.  Those were all culled out of this AutoCorrect2 package.  Only the 8 core files were kept.  The original download has 185 files/folders.  It is a .tar.gz compressed file... I used 7zip to extract it.
