; Intended for updating AutoHotkey scripts.  kunkel321 10-19-2025 
; A script to find duplicate hotstrings that are in one file but not another. 
; Default files to scan can be entered.  If they are not found, a file-picker will appear.
; The "mainFile" is the file that you plan to use--it is your new AutoCorrect file.
; The "extraFile" is a different version of your file, that might have new custom hotstrings
; added, that are not in the new mainFile.
